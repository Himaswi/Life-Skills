## 1. Which point(s) were new to you?

- The idea of over-communicating proactively, especially informing the team early about delays or issues, was new to me.
- Using tools like screenshots, Loom videos, and GitHub gists to explain problems clearly was also something I learned.
- I also found it helpful to learn that joining meetings a few minutes early can improve team communication.

## 2. Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

- I need to improve how I explain problems when I am stuck. I will start sharing clear details and steps I tried.

- I want to get better at over-communicating delays or issues instead of waiting too long.

- I will practice taking proper notes during discussions and share them for confirmation.

- I plan to reduce distractions during work hours by silencing notifications and limiting social media.

- I will work on building better rapport with teammates by communicating more actively in group channels.
