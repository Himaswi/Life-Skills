## 1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
- The most interesting idea for me was how small actions, like doing a habit for just a few seconds, can slowly build real change. It showed that starting tiny removes pressure and makes habits easier to stick with.
## 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
B = MAP means Behavior happens when Motivation, Ability, and Prompt come together.
- M (Motivation): how much you want to do the habit
- A (Ability): how easy the habit is to do
- P (Prompt): the reminder or trigger
- By increasing ability (making the habit tiny) and using strong prompts, it becomes much easier to start new habits even when motivation is low.
## 3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
- Celebrating after completing a small habit gives your brain a positive feeling. This emotion helps your mind connect the habit with something rewarding, making you want to repeat it automatically. In simple words, what you celebrate becomes stronger.
## 4. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
- The idea that improving just 1% every day can lead to huge long-term results was the most interesting. It showed how small improvements add up over months and years, even when they look tiny in the beginning.
## 5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?
- The book says that the best way to build habits is to focus on who you want to become, not just what you want to achieve. Your habits should match your identity, like “I am a healthy person” instead of “I want to lose weight.”
## 6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
The book explains that habits become easier when you:
- Reduce the steps
- Make the habit simple and accessible
- Remove any friction
When something takes less effort, your brain finds it easier to repeat.
## 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
To reduce a bad habit, you make it difficult by:
- Adding friction
- Increasing the number of steps
- Making it less convenient
When a habit becomes harder, you naturally stop doing it often.
## 8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
Habit: Solve at least one LeetCode problem every day
Steps to make this habit easy:
- I will fix a clear time in the morning to solve at least one LeetCode problem every day.
- I will start with easy problems and spend just 20 minutes, so it feels simple to begin.
- I will keep LeetCode open as a bookmark to make the habit quick to start.
- I will track my daily progress and celebrate small wins to keep myself motivated.
## 9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
Habit: Using Social media 
Steps I will take:
- Turn off non-essential notifications
- Log out of apps that distract me
- Remind myself how much time I save by avoiding them
